<h2>About Me </h2>
<p> There is so much about me. It would take me four webpages to fill that out. I am taking this course because I want to persue a career in soft ware development.  
    When I am asked about my college experience, I always respond that I would go back and get a degree in computer science. Time to put my money where my mouth is.
    Additionally, here are three things about me:
